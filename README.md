#### <!--Badges-->

<!--On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use [Shields](http://shields.io/) to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.-->

## Overview

<!--Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of **Features** or a **Background** subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.-->



## Features

####  Visuals

<!--Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.-->

#### Constraints

<!--Enumeration of all non-functional requirements and restrictions directly related to the installation and launch of the product.-->

#### Architecture

<!--Description of the product architecture in accordance with one of the documentation templates. A brief overview of the basic architectural ideas is recommended. It is also highly recommended to present these ideas graphically in the form of uml-diagrams.-->



## Getting Started

<!--These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.-->

<!--Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a **Requirements** subsection.-->



#### Prerequisites

<!--What things you need to install the software and how to install them-->

- <!--One-->
- <!--Two-->
- <!--Three-->
- <!--Four-->

```
Give the example
```



#### Installation

<!--A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running-->

<!--Say what the step will be-->

```
Give the example
```



#### Building

<!--A description of the steps that should be taken to locally build the project. There should also be a description of how to configure the software environment, run unit tests, code quality analyzers, and so on.-->

```
Give the example
```



#### Deployment

<!--Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.-->

```
Give the example

## Usage

<!--Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.-->



## Support

<!--Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.-->



## Roadmap

<!--If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.-->



## Contributing

<!--State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.-->

<!--For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.-->

<!--You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.-->



## Authors and Acknowledgment

<!--Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.-->



## License

<!--For open source projects, say how it is licensed.-->



## Project status

<!--If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.-->
